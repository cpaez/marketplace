            <h2>WHAT IS AN OPEN SPACE?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="item item-body">
            <p>Open space (a.k.a. Unconference) is a way to organize participant-driven workshops and conferences.
            Participants take control over creating, facilitating and attending (or not) sessions during the open space.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="item item-body">
            <p>Nothing really. Only rooms and time slots are prepared. Everything else is given by participants.</p>

            <h2>HOW DO WE START?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="item item-body">
            <p>We will start with an introduction on what is open space and how to attend. There will be moderators
                helping to set up sessions and make sure all works smoothly.<br />
                Then we will set up the session board. Everyone will be able to post something to the board. Some
                subjects will surely be waiting as well – you can propose a subject even before the open space starts.</p>

            <h2>IF I PROPOSE A SESSION, DO I HAVE TO CONDUCT IT?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="item item-body">
            <p>NO – and that’s one of the most important rules. If you want to talk about something, you appear
            in a certain place and talk about it.<br />
            DO I HAVE TO SPEAK IN THE SESSION I’M ATTENDING?<br />
            NO – you can only listen if you prefer.<br />
            DO I HAVE TO STAY FOR THE WHOLE SESSION?<br />
            NO – the rule of two feet says: If you’re not learning nor contributing, leave.<br />
            Even if you initiated this session.</p>

            <p>The person guiding the session sums it up and brings findings to a common place, where they get
            posted for all to see.</p>

            <p>Facilitator – someone experienced with open spaces, will be happy to help<br />
            Initiator – someone who put the subject up. He or she wants to talk about it<br />
            Bumblebee – someone visiting sessions for short periods, cross-pollinating ideas<br />
            Butterfly – beautiful and silent – only listens and learns<br />

            <h2>RULES:</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="item item-body">
            <p>Whoever comes is the right people – if you want to talk about it, please do. If you want to listen, please do.<br />
            Whenever it starts is the right time – you don’t have to wait – start right away<br />
            Wherever it is, is the right place - you pick a spot<br />
            When it’s over, it’s over – you don’t have to artificially fill the time slot. If you finish early – finish it. If you
            want to continue – initiate another slot<br />
            The rule of two feet: If you’re not learning nor contributing, leave.</p>
